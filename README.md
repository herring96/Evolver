Evolver

Evolving program like cleverbot

Hi, this is a simple python program that is meant to replicate a 'cleverbot' type program by responding to known user
input randomly and asking about input it does not understand. Once the unknown input has been defined the program stores
it in a dictionary so it can reference it next time that input is used. 

The 'evolve.py' file is the main file and references functions from the 'extras.py' file

Furthermore to actually use this program you will need the 3 other files I have titled "defs.txt", 
"responses.txt", and "users.txt".
