Evolving program like cleverbot

Hi, this is a simple python program that is meant to replicate a 'cleverbot' type program by responding to known user
input randomly and asking about input it does not understand. Once the unknown input has been defined the program stores
it in a dictionary so it can reference it next time that input is used. 

Furthermore to actually use this program you will need 3 other files I have not put up yet titled "defs.txt", 
"responses.txt", and "users.txt".

*These should be available shortly*
