Evolving program like cleverbot

Hi, this is a simple python program that is meant to replicate a 'cleverbot' type program by responding to known user
input randomly and asking about input it does not understand. Once the unknown input has been defined the program stores
it in a dictionary so it can reference it next time that input is used. 

The 'evolve.py' file is the main file and references functions from the 'extras.py' file

Furthermore to actually use this program you will need the 3 other files I have titled "defs.txt", 
"responses.txt", and "users.txt".
 
 If you would like to test how the program works, try asking it "do you like [insert a noun]" If the noun is not in the dictionary, the response will be "what is a [noun]". You may then define it and ask "what is a [noun]" and the response will be the deffinition you just provided.
 
 *Finally this program was written with python 3.0.1 so ensure you have the latest version for it to work properly*
